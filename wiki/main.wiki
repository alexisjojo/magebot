=MageBot.mac=

This macro is meant to be a macro capable of running the mage fully by itself.  It has a full featured solo mode where you use a prerecorded path, using pathRecord.mac, to run around and kill mobs.  Groupmode is still somewhat limited but has basic functionality to assist a group in killing mobs without user interaction.
